Code Style
=====

Simply put, use 4 spaces for your tabs (soft tabs) with a tabstop of 8 characters.  In VIM this means when you indent, it should only insert 4 spaces.  Used with autoindent, this should make the code easy to read and match up with the current code in the repository.

Try to be as pythonic as possible.  Events over declarations if possible, for example.  

Do not code game rules in the main repository.  Instead, create a plugin for those rules.
